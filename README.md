# Weather-API-Dashboard
A Dashboard displaying the weather in different cities over a 5 day period.

In this project, I created a dashboard that displays the weather report over a 5 day period, utilising weather API. 

Firstly, I created a function to get the user input and return and display  fetch api data in both the large card and the 5 smaller cards, one for each day of the week. Secondly, saved the inputs in local storage. Then, I created a function to render buttons from the local storage history which are retrieved on page load.
